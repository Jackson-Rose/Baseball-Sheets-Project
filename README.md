# Baseball-Sheets-Project

This spreadsheet is meant to convert a large number of single-game statlines (ex. 2-4, HR, 3 RBI, R) into a dashboard that contains the sum of all relevant counting stats (home runs, RBIs, runs, etc.) and the resulting slash line (AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS). 

This project uses custom functions written in javascript using Google's App Script platform, and as a result, must be used in Google Sheets. 
To launch the project, simply upload either of the spreadsheet files to Google Drive, select the "open with" dropdown menu and choose Google Sheets. 
Next, select Extensions, click App Script, and paste one of the .js files into the IDE. Repeat for the next two, creating a new script file for each. Save and deploy, and the spreadsheet will work as intended.
